# LIVESTOCK MIGRATION

The final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Kenya has a lot of livestock for example cows, sheep, and goats. Recently, livestock theft has occurred in some parts of the country. This AI through machine learning will be able to capture the movements of livestock to find any stolen one. Through its visual training, it can make inferences when any livestock moves from one point to another.


## Background

The program can be able to solve livestock theft.
The problem has occurred multiple times.
This topic is one of the key issues causing war in parts of my country.


## How is it used?

The AI program can be used by the police force to be able to track livestock thieves.


## Data sources and AI methods
My data comes from ICPAD. The AI method used is Visual AI.


## Challenges
There is a group of communities who are pastoralists, it can be hard to monitor their movement and the livestock.
Accessibility to areas with livestock mainly in the rural areas is hard.

## What next?

The program would need a large amount of data about the livestock and their ownership.

## Acknowledgments

This is my basic idea which am still thinking and analyzing further.
